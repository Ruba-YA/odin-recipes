  <p>Quick, easy and definitely delicious. Spicy sausage and creamy cavatelli is tossed with tangy broccoli rabe in a delicate chicken and wine sauce. I also use gnocchi in place of the cavatelli on occasion.</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
<li>2 pounds ricotta cavatelli</li>
<li>1 pound broccoli rabe, chopped</li>
<li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
<li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>

<li>2 tablespoons concentrated chicken stock (such as KnorrÂ®)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps : </h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook cavatelli in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, 9 to 11 minutes. Drain.</li>
